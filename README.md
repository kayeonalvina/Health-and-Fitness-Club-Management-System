# Health-and-Fitness-Club-Management-System

A program meant to simulate the usage of a health and fitness club, with members, trainers, different equipment and an event schedule, using databases.

# Setting Up Your Database

This requires pgAdmin 4, which is a GUI for PostgreSQL. You can download it from [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

1. Open up pgAdmin 4 and create a new Database, named "healthclub".
2. Go to "postgres" in "Login/Group Roles" and access the Properties. In the Definition tab, set up the password to be "password".
3. If password changed, restart pgAdmin4.
4. Use the ddl and dml .sql files to create sample data for the tables, or you can substitute dml.sql with your own data of choice. You can erase the database by using clear.sql.

# Running The Program

Using a command line in the appropriate directory, run "python main.py" to run the Command-Line Interface of this program. You will recieve input until you explicitly state to exit.
